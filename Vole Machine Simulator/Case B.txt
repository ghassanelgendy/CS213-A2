JUMP to the instruction located in the memory cell at address XY 
if the bit pattern in register R
is equal to the bit pattern in register number 0. Otherwise, 
continue with the normal sequence of
execution. (The jump is implemented by copying XY 
into the program counter during the execute phase.)
Example: B43C would first compare the contents of register 4 
with the contents of register 0. If
the two were equal, the pattern 3C would be placed in the 
program counter so that the next
instruction executed would be the one 
located at that memory address. Otherwise, nothing would be done and program execution would continue in its normal sequence.
